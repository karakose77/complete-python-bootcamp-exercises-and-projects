    * You will then guess a 3 digit number.
    * The computer will then give back clues.
    * Based on these clues you will guess again until you break the code with a match!
    * The possible clues are:  
        Close: You've guessed a correct number but in the wrong position.  
        Match: You've guessed a correct number in the correct position.
        Nope: You haven't guess any of the numbers correctly.

28. **["mk028_war.ipynb"](https://github.com/karakose77/complete-python-bootcamp-exercises-and-projects/blob/master/mk028_war.ipynb)**: A card game named "War". The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player  places his stack of cards face down, in front of him.
Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the  higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.
If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up three cards face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on. Ignores "double" wars.
